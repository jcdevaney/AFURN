!!!Laitz: 137, 225
!!!Note: Unsure whether the analysis suggests that this excerpt consists of one phrase or two phrases  (with X14_7d2) as the book calls the half cadence a back-relating dominant (292) and the second phrase starts with a preodominant chord.  This excerpt does create a parallel continuous period.
