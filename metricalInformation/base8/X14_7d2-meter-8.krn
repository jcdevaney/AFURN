!!!COM: Beethoven 
!!!OTL: Exercise 14.7d2, Piano Sonata no. 7 in D major, op. 10, no. 3, Menuetto, Allegro
!!!Laitz: 137, 225
!!!Note: Unsure whether the analysis suggests that this excerpt consists of one phrase or two phrases (with X14_7d) as the book calls the half cadence a back-relating dominant (292) and the second phrase starts with a preodominant chord.  This excerpt does create a parallel continuous period.
